"""
Implementation of the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using a naive approach.

This module provides a solution to the TSP using a brute-force approach that
examines all possible permutations of cities to find the minimum cost path.

Note:
    This implementation is suitable for small instances of TSP (typically n â‰¤ 10)
    due to its factorial time complexity.

    Find the minimum weight Hamiltonian cycle in a graph starting from a specified vertex.
    
    This function implements a naive solution to the Traveling Salesman Problem
    by generating all possible permutations of vertices and finding the minimum
    cost path that visits all vertices exactly once and returns to the start.
    
    Args:
        graph (List[List[int]]): A V x V matrix representing the weighted graph.
            graph[i][j] represents the weight of edge from vertex i to vertex j.
        s (int): The starting vertex (0 <= s < V)
    
    Returns:
        int: The minimum weight of the Hamiltonian cycle starting from vertex s.
            If no valid path exists, returns sys.maxsize
    
    Raises:
        ValueError: If the graph dimensions don't match V x V or if s is not in range [0, V-1]
        
    Example:
        >>> graph = [
        ...     [0, 10, 15, 20],
        ...     [10, 0, 35, 25],
